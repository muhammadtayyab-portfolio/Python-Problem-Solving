# Day 12: Treasure Island Adventure 🏝️

A text-based "Choose Your Own Adventure" game with multiple paths and outcomes.

## 📝 Description
The player is on a mission to find a hidden treasure. Every choice leads to either a "Game Over" or the next stage of the journey. It’s a classic logic-building project.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Control Flow:** Complex branching logic.
* **User Experience:** Guiding the player through a narrative using `print` and `input`.
