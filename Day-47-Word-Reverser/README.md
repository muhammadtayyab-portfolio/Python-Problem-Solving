# 🔁 Day 47: Sentence Word Reverser

A Python script that reverses each word in a sentence individually while keeping the original word order intact.

---

## 📝 Description
This program takes a sentence, splits it into individual words, and then reverses each word character-by-character without changing the overall word sequence.

## 🛠️ Logic
- Sentence ko words mein split kiya jata hai.
- Nested loop (backward range) use karke har word ke characters ko reverse kiya jata hai.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open the project directory in a terminal.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
````

4. Enter a sentence when prompted.
