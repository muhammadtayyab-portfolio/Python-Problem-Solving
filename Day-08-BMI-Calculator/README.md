# Day 08: BMI Calculator ⚖️

An advanced Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that provides health categories based on user input.

## 📝 Description
This program calculates the BMI using weight (kg) and height (m). Unlike the basic version, it uses complex conditional logic (`if-elif-else`) to categorize the result into various health levels, from Underweight to Clinically Obese.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Exponent Operator (`**`):** Used for calculating height squared.
* **Rounding:** Using the `round()` function to get a clean integer BMI.
* **Elif Ladder:** Chaining multiple conditions to check different ranges.
* **f-Strings:** Providing a personalized summary of the result.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python main.py
