# Day 04: Brand Name Generator 🎸

A simple Python program that demonstrates string manipulation and user input handling.

## 📝 Description
This project takes two pieces of information from the user (their city and a pet's name) and combines them using string concatenation to suggest a cool band name.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Input Function:** Taking data from users via `input()`.
* **String Concatenation:** Merging multiple strings using the `+` operator.
* **New Line Character:** Using `\n` to manage the cursor position for better user experience.

## 🚀 How to Run
Run the script using:
```bash
python main.py
