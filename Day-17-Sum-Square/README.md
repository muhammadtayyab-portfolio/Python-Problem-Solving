# Day 17: Sum-Square Even-Odd Checker 🧮

Calculates the square of the sum of two numbers and determines its parity.

## 📝 Description
The user provides two numbers; the program calculates $(num1 + num2)^2$ and uses the modulo operator to check if the result is even or odd.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Exponent Operator:** Using `**2` for squaring.
* **Parity Check:** Using `% 2` for even/odd logic.
