# Day 24: Digits Product Calculator 🔢

A Python script that calculates the product of all individual digits in a given number stream.

## 📝 Description
This program takes a multi-digit number as input from the user. It treats the input as a string to iterate through each digit, converts them back to integers, and calculates their cumulative product.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Accumulator Pattern:** Initializing a variable (`result = 1`) to store the running product.
* **For Loops:** Iterating through each character of the input string.
* **Type Conversion:** Converting string characters to integers for calculation.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python main.py
