# Day 27: Prime Divisors Finder 🔍

A script that identifies all divisors of a number and filters out those that are prime.

## 📝 Description
This program finds every number that can divide the input integer and then uses a nested loop to check if those divisors are prime numbers. It’s a great exercise for practicing nested conditional logic.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Nested For Loops:** One to find divisors and another to check primality.
* **Primality Test:** Verifying if a factor has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
* **Conditional Logic:** Filtering divisors using the modulo operator.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python main.py
