# Day 07: Odd or Even Checker 🔢

A simple Python program to identify whether a given number is even or odd.

## 📝 Description
This script takes an integer input from the user and uses the modulo operator `%` to check for divisibility by 2. This is a fundamental exercise in understanding conditional statements and arithmetic operators.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Modulo Operator (`%`):** Used to find the remainder of a division.
* **Conditional Logic:** Using `if-else` blocks to direct the program's flow.
* **Input Casting:** Converting user input into an `int`.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python main.py
