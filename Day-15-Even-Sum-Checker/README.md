# Day 15: Even Digit Sum Checker ➕

A program that filters digits from a number stream and calculates the sum of even digits only.

## 📝 Description
This script iterates through a string of numbers, identifies even digits, and checks if their total sum is also an even or odd number.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **String Iteration:** Using a `for` loop to traverse characters.
* **Type Casting:** Converting string characters to `int` for math.
