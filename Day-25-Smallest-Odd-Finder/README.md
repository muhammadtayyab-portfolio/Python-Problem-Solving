# Day 25: Smallest Odd Number Finder 🔢

A Python script that identifies the smallest odd number from a set of user-provided integers.

## 📝 Description
This program asks the user for 5 different numbers and filters out the odd ones. It then compares them to find and display the smallest odd value. If no odd numbers are entered, it informs the user accordingly.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **List Iteration:** Using a `for` loop to check multiple inputs efficiently.
* **Modulo Operator (`%`):** To differentiate between even and odd numbers.
* **None Type & Initialization:** Using `None` to handle cases where no odd number might be found.
* **Conditional Logic:** Comparing current numbers with the stored `smallest_odd` value.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python main.py
