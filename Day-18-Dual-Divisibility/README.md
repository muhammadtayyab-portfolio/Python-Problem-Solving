# Day 18: Dual Divisibility Range ⚖️

Finds and prints numbers within a range that are divisible by both 2 and 3 simultaneously.

## 📝 Description
This script takes an ending number `n` and iterates from 1 to `n`, printing only those numbers that satisfy the condition $(i \% 2 == 0 \text{ and } i \% 3 == 0)$.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Range Function:** Generating a sequence of numbers.
* **Logical AND:** Combining two divisibility conditions.
