# Day 28: Prime Square Generator 🧮

Iterates through a range and squares numbers only if they are prime.

## 📝 Description
For every number from 1 to `n`, the script checks for primality. If a number is prime, it prints its square; otherwise, it prints the number normally.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Flag Variables:** Using `is_prime = True` to track the status of a number.
* **Exponentiation:** Calculating the square using the `**` operator.
* **Range Management:** Iterating from 1 to the user-defined limit.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python main.py
