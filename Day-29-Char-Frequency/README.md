# Day 29: Character Frequency Tracker 📊

Calculates and displays the occurrence of each unique character in a string.

## 📝 Description
This program scans an input string and prints how many times each character appears. It uses a helper string to ensure that the count for each unique character is only printed once.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **String Methods:** Using `s.count(i)` to calculate character frequency.
* **Membership Testing:** Using `not in` to track and skip already processed characters.
* **Iteration:** Looping through the input string to analyze each character.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python main.py
