# Day 16: Reverse & Difference Calculator 🔄

A mathematical script that reverses an integer and calculates the difference between the original and reversed values.

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates how to manipulate numbers without converting them into strings. It uses a `while` loop to extract digits one by one and reconstructs them in reverse order. Finally, it calculates the mathematical difference: (Original Number - Reversed Number).

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **While Loops:** To iterate until the number becomes zero.
* **Modulo Operator (`%`):** To extract the last digit of a number.
* **Floor Division (`//`):** To remove the last digit after processing.
* **Variable Preservation:** Storing the original number in `or_num` before the loop modifies the input.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python main.py
