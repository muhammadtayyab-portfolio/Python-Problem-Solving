# Day 2: Input & String Length Calculator 📏

### 📝 Description
On the second day, I explored how to interact with users by taking dynamic inputs and performing operations on that data. This project calculates the number of characters in a given username.

### 💡 Key Learnings
* **`input()` Function:** Learned how to pause the program and wait for user data.
* **`len()` Function:** Used to calculate the number of items in an object or characters in a string.
* **Dynamic Interaction:** Moving from static print statements to user-driven logic.

### 🚀 Code Snippet
```python
name = input("Name: ")
print(len(name))
