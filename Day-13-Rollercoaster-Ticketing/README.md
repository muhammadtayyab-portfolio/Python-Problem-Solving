# Day 13: Rollercoaster Ticketing System 🎢

A comprehensive ticketing application that calculates ride eligibility and pricing based on height, age, and extra services.

## 📝 Description
This program checks if a person is tall enough to ride a rollercoaster. If eligible, it calculates the ticket price based on their age category and offers an optional photo service. It also includes a special "Mid-life Crisis" discount where riders between 45-55 years old get a free ticket.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Nested Conditionals:** Checking age and photos only if the height requirement is met.
* **Logical Operators:** Using `and` for age ranges and `or` for handling different user inputs (Yes/yes).
* **Multiple Elif Blocks:** Categorizing age groups (Child, Youth, Adult).
* **Flag/Variable Update:** Updating the `price` variable dynamically based on choices.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python main.py
