# Day 09: Leap Year Checker 📅

A logical program to determine if a given year is a leap year using nested conditional statements.

## 📝 Description
This project implements the complex logic of leap years:
1. Must be divisible by 4.
2. If divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400.
It's a great exercise for practicing **Nested If** structures.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Nested If-Else:** Checking conditions within conditions.
* **Modulo Operator (`%`):** For divisibility checks.

## 📸 Output Example
```text
Enter a year: 2024
Leap year.
