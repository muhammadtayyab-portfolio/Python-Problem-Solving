# Day 3: Variable Swapping Logic 🔄

### 📝 Description
This project demonstrates the fundamental logic of swapping two variables using a third temporary variable. This is a classic programming exercise used to understand memory allocation and variable assignment.

### 💡 Key Learnings
* **Variable Assignment:** Understanding how values move from one memory location to another.
* **Temporary Variable (The Third Cup Logic):** To swap two values, we need a middle-man (temp) to prevent data loss.
* **F-Strings:** Using formatted strings for cleaner and more readable output.

### 🧠 The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. `temp = a` (Save A's value)
2. `a = b` (Overwrite A with B's value)
3. `b = temp` (Put A's original value into B)
