# Day 23: Vowel Remover & Reverser 🔄

A two-in-one string processor that reverses a word while stripping out all vowels.

## 📝 Description
This script traverses a string backwards, checks if each character is a vowel, and if not, appends it to a new string.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
* **Membership Operators:** Using `not in` with a list of vowels.
* **Reverse Iteration:** Starting from `len(str)-1` down to `0`.
